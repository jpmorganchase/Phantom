# Phantom

> A Multi-agent reinforcement-learning simulator built on top of RLlib.


## Installation


```sh
make install-deps
make install
```


## Reproducibility

ML experiment reproducibility can be hard. There are several common pitfalls in Python
that can be hard to spot. To reduce these problems it is recommended that the user uses
the included `phantom` command which wraps the system python interpreter. This is
configured to help ensure the production of reproducible results.


## Development setup


```sh
make install-dev-deps
make dev
```
